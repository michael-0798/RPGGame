# RPGGame
The game is created by Java, using the basic knowledge of Polymorphism and Enum. It comes from one of the assignment of Java course. 

One of the highlights of this assignment, comparing with others in class, is that the subclasses shadow the fields which declared in parent class, which omits a lot of "setter" and "getter" method, making the code more concise and efficient.
